# How can I help?
If you are a developer feel free to make any addition to improve PiPifier.

If you are user and want a native PiP button in any video player please make a request in the corresponding [issue](https://github.com/arnoappenzeller/PiPifier/issues/12)

# Note for developers
The code is a bit dirty and there are some unused parts in it (Tried to add more features before I needed to focus on other things). If you want to help me clean it up feel free to do so :)
